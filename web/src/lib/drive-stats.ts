//   - crates/drives/src/db.rs  (lifetime `drive_stats` cache → /api/drives/stats)
//   - crates/drives/src/grouper.rs::build_fsd_analytics  (/api/drives/fsd-analytics)
// Both Rust paths compute FSD% as distance-based and SEI-only. Earlier this
// helper computed it as engaged-ms / total-ms which produced numbers
// 10-15 points lower than the FSD Analytics page for the same window.
//
// Top-line totals (count, distance, duration) include every drive in the
// window. FSD/Autopilot ratios are SEI-only — Tessie's autopilot data is
// inferred rather than read from dashcam SEI telemetry, so mixing it would
// dilute the score.
