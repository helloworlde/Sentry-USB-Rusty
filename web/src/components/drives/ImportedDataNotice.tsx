 * drives come from an external service's API rather than the dashcam —
 * so the headline totals can differ by a small amount across the three.
 * Dismissible; the choice persists in localStorage.
 *
 * `count` / `importedCount` are the filtered-window drive counts from
 * `DrivesFilteredStats` (importedCount == tessieCount: every non-SEI
 * drive). When there are no imported drives the three apps agree to
 * floating-point precision, so the banner stays hidden.
