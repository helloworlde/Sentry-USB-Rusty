//! Setup error classification.
//!
//! `ConfigError` marks a failure caused by bad or contradictory user
//! configuration (two keep-awake providers, an invalid `SENTRY_CASE`, a
//! too-short `AP_PASS`, a missing required archive field) as distinct
//! from a transient or hardware failure.
//!
//! The web server downcasts to this type to decide whether to keep
//! silently auto-resuming setup on every boot (safe for transient
//! failures — a network blip clears itself) or to stop and surface a
//! "fix your settings and retry" state (config failures retry
//! identically forever, which is the setup boot-loop users hit).

/// A setup failure caused by invalid user configuration.
///
/// Recoverable only by the user changing settings — re-running setup
/// unchanged fails the same way, so the boot-loop auto-resume must halt
/// on these rather than spin forever.
