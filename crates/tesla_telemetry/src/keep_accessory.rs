//! Keep-Accessory-Power automation policy.
//!
//! "Keep Accessory Power" (the toggle on the Tesla app's Charging
//! screen) holds the car's 12V accessory outlets (cigarette lighter)
//! live after the car would otherwise cut them. For a Pi powered from
//! that outlet — NOT the glovebox USB, which the car feeds itself
//! during Sentry — this is what keeps the Pi alive while parked.
//!
//! This policy auto-manages that toggle from signals the sampler
//! already computes each tick, so the user never touches it:
//!
//!   * **Away from home → ON.** Pre-armed the moment you leave the
//!     home geofence (still moving), so it's already on before you
//!     park and the car cuts accessory power. Stays on the whole time
//!     parked away → Sentry/dashcam coverage with the Pi powered.
//!   * **Home + parked → hold ON until the archive finishes, then
//!     OFF.** Guarantees the archive completes with power, then lets
//!     the car sleep and the Pi power down cleanly (no half-archives,
//!     no battery drain sitting in your own garage).
//!
//! Gated behind `KEEP_ACCESSORY_ENABLED` (a user-declared "my Pi is
//! powered from the 12V outlet" flag) + a home geofence
//! (`KEEP_ACCESSORY_HOME_LAT/LON`, `..._RADIUS_M`). A radius circle —
//! not an address-string match — because Tesla's reverse-geocoded
//! address drifts (it'll say you're "at your neighbor's"); the
//! geofence swallows that jitter.
//!
//! The Tesla protocol is **write-only** for this field — there's no
//! readable "is keep-accessory on?" state — so the policy tracks its
//! OWN last-sent value and only issues a BLE action on a change.
