//! IPC bridge so external processes (`sentryusb-ble-action`) can ask
//! the running telemetry daemon to perform a one-shot BLE action via
//! its existing `PersistentSession` instead of opening a separate
//! connection.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! Before this socket, every `awake_start` keep-awake cycle had to:
//!   1. Stop the telemetry daemon (`systemctl stop sentryusb-telemetry`)
//!      so its persistent BLE connection didn't fight ble-action for
//!      the car's slot.
//!   2. Run `sentryusb-ble-action <verb>`, which opens its own BLE
//!      connection, handshakes, sends the action, disconnects.
//!   3. Restart telemetry (at the end of the archive cycle via
//!      `awake_stop`).
//!
//! Effect: live data went dark for the entire archive duration (could
//! be 30+ minutes during a big upload). Users complained, reasonably.
//!
//! With the rewrite both telemetry and ble-action are now in-process
//! Rust on top of btleplug, so we can collapse the two into a single
//! BLE owner — the daemon. ble-action checks for this socket first;
//! if present, it pipes the verb in, the daemon dispatches via its
//! already-warm PersistentSession (no reconnect, no slot juggling),
//! and ble-action exits with the result.
//!
//! ## Fallback path preserved
//!
//! If the daemon isn't running (BLE telemetry not enabled, or daemon
//! crashed), the socket file is absent and ble-action falls back to
//! the original direct-BLE path. Users who don't run telemetry keep
//! working exactly as before.
//!
//! ## Protocol
//!
//! Line-delimited text — trivial to debug with `nc -U` from a root
//! shell:
//! ```text
//!   client → server : "<verb>\n"
//!   server → client : "OK\n"  or  "ERR <message>\n"
//! ```
//!
//! Where `<verb>` is one of:
//!   `wake`, `sentry-on`, `sentry-off`, `charge-port-open`,
//!   `charge-port-close`, `session-info`.
//!
//! `session-info` is special: instead of a one-shot action it runs a
//! pairing probe over the held connection and replies `OK` (paired),
//! `ERR NOT_PAIRED` (car rejected our key), or `ERR UNREACHABLE: <why>`
//! (couldn't reach the car). Handled in `main::handle_action_request`,
//! not `parse_verb` (which only maps action verbs).
//!
//! Socket lives at `/tmp/sentryusb-telemetry.sock` with mode 0600 —
//! only root can connect (matches `sentryusb-ble-action`'s usual
//! invocation context).
