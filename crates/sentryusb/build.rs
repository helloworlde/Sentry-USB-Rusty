//! Guarantees the rust-embed source folder (`static/`) exists at compile
//! time so a bare `cargo build` still compiles.
//!
//! The real web UI is produced by `npm run build` and copied into
//! `static/` by `build.sh` and the CI release job. That output is
//! gitignored and never committed: a stale *committed* copy silently
//! shipped an old UI when someone ran `cargo build` without first
//! rebuilding the frontend (the `static/` `.gitignore` entry exists for
//! exactly this reason).
//!
//! When `static/` has no `index.html` (a fresh checkout, or a
//! backend-only `cargo build`/`check`/`test`), write an unmistakable
//! placeholder so the resulting binary serves a clear "frontend not
//! built" page — never a stale or empty one. CI's frontend step runs
//! before the cargo build, so by then `static/index.html` already
//! exists and this script is a no-op (it never clobbers a real build).
