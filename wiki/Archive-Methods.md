# Archive Methods

Pick whichever fits how you already store stuff. Sentry USB archives your dashcam clips, sentry events, and (optionally) saved clips to one of four backends.

## CIFS / SMB

For Windows file sharing, macOS file sharing, and most consumer NAS devices (Synology, QNAP, TrueNAS).

**On your server:** create a shared folder, give a user read/write access, note the share name.

**In the wizard:**

| Field | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Archive Server | `192.168.1.100` or `nas.local` |
| Share Name | `TeslaCam` or `media/dashcam` |
| Username | `tesla` |
| Password | _your password_ |
| CIFS Version | leave blank unless you know you need 2.0 / 1.0 |

If the connection fails, the most common cause is an older NAS that needs `CIFS_VERSION=2.0` set explicitly.

## rsync

For Linux/Unix servers. Faster and more reliable than CIFS over the open internet, but requires SSH key setup.

**On your server:** create a user, create a destination folder.

**In the wizard:**

| Field | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Server | `archive.example.com` |
| Username | `tesla` |
| Remote Path | `/home/tesla/dashcam` |

**After the wizard finishes**, you need to copy the Pi's SSH public key to the server. SSH into the Pi:

```bash
ssh-copy-id <username>@<server>
```

You'll only have to do this once.

## rclone

For cloud storage — Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, S3, Backblaze B2, and ~60 other providers. Best for offsite backups.

**Set up the remote first** by SSH'ing into the Pi and running:

```bash
sudo -u sentryusb rclone config
```

Follow the prompts — it'll ask which cloud service, walk you through OAuth, and let you name the remote (e.g., `gdrive`).

**In the wizard:**

| Field | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Remote Name | `gdrive` (matches the name you set in `rclone config`) |
| Remote Path | `Dashcam` or `Backups/TeslaCam` |

## NFS

For Linux NAS devices that prefer NFS over CIFS (some Synology and TrueNAS setups). **Typically faster than CIFS / SMB** on the same hardware — worth using if you have a lot of clips to back up and your NAS supports it.

**On your server:** export a directory in `/etc/exports` (or your NAS's GUI), allow the Pi's IP.

**In the wizard:**

| Field | Example |
|-------|---------|
| NFS Server | `192.168.1.100` |
| Export Path | `/volume1/TeslaCam` (the exact path from your `exports` file) |

NFS is unauthenticated — anyone on your LAN with the path can read/write. Use CIFS or rsync if that's a concern.

## Switching methods later

You can re-run the [Setup Wizard](Setup-Wizard-Guide) from **Settings** to switch backends. Already-archived clips stay where they are — Sentry USB doesn't re-archive past clips, only future ones go to the new destination.
