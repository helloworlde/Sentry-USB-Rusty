# Archive unmount runs in the FOREGROUND under the shared flock, so an
# in-flight API backup (which holds the lock across its mount+write)
# can't have the mount force-lazy-unmounted mid-write. Bounded: the
# umount itself is capped at 10s and the lock wait at 300s, so this
# can't wedge the return to archiveloop the way an uncapped unmount
# once could. Fail-closed on lock timeout: unmounting without the lock
# is exactly the mid-write teardown the lock exists to prevent — skip,
# and the next cycle's disconnect gets another chance. Music has no
# API writer, so it keeps the old backgrounded, lock-free path.
