# SentryUSB (Rust) Installer
#
# Minimal installer — downloads the Rust binary and installs the systemd
# service. The binary itself handles ALL setup (partitioning, disk images,
# system config, etc.) via the web UI setup wizard.
#
# Usage:
#   sudo -i
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sentry-Six/Sentry-USB-Rusty/main/install-pi.sh | bash
#
# Or with a local binary:
#   bash install-pi.sh /path/to/sentryusb-binary
