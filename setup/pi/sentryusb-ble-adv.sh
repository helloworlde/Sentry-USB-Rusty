# Legacy ADV_IND advertiser for Broadcom Pi-family chips where BlueZ's modern
# advertising path is unreliable (the BCM controllers reject EXTENDED
# advertising, and even `btmgmt advertising on` defaults to non-connectable
# parameters on some chip revisions). Programs advertising directly over raw
# HCI as connectable undirected (ADV_IND) at 100ms intervals.
#
# The SentryUSB apps filter scans by the "SentryUSB-" name prefix, so the
# local name MUST appear in the scan response (BlueZ doesn't include the
# name in this path by default, hence the explicit scan-rsp builder below).
# Fresh flag = a central connect is in flight; don't re-assert advertising then.
