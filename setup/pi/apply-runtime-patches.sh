#
# Idempotent re-application of all install-time patches that must survive
# a binary OTA update. Called by:
#   - install-pi.sh        — initial install / re-install via curl
#   - crates/api/src/update.rs — after every in-app binary swap
#
# Why this exists: the in-app updater (Settings → System → Check for
# Updates) only swaps the Rust binary. It does NOT re-run install-pi.sh.
# So install-time fixes (BLE non-fatal-adv on BCM4345C0, etc.) that are
# applied to shipped scripts on disk silently rot the moment a release
# replaces those scripts — leaving every existing 4C+ user with a
# crash-looped Bluetooth stack after their first update.
#
# This script is the bridge: it re-applies the patches every time the
# updater runs, so existing installs heal automatically on update without
# needing a re-install.
#
# Detection-gated: each patch's apply-block self-checks for the board /
# precondition it cares about, so running on a Pi 4 or Pi 5 (or amd64
# dev box) is a no-op.
#
# Safe to re-run anytime: every patch first checks if the marker is
# already present in the target file.

# and lets systemd re-spawn the daemon in a fast crash loop. The Pi's actual
# advertising is handled out-of-band by sentryusb-ble-adv.service via raw
# HCI (ADV_IND programmed directly), so the BlueZ failure is legitimately
# non-fatal — we just need the GATT server to stay up. Patch swallows the
# BlueZ adv error and logs it instead.
