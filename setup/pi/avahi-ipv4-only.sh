# avahi-ipv4-only.sh — make Avahi advertise <hostname>.local over IPv4 only.
#
# Why: Windows/Chrome prefer the AAAA answer for .local names. The Pi's
# global SLAAC address rotates (IPv6 privacy extensions), so the advertised
# AAAA goes stale and page loads stall until IPv4 fallback. Worse, Chrome
# classifies a global IPv6 address as *public* address space, so the plain
# http:// Web UI loaded through it gets Private Network Access blocks that
# surface as "blocked by CORS policy: ... not a secure context ... more-
# restricted address space" errors. Advertising the A record only fixes
# both. Kernel/socket IPv6 on the device is untouched — this only changes
# what mDNS hands out.
#
# Edits are section-aware (a use-ipv6 line under [publish] can keep avahi
# from starting), dedupe repeated assignments, and append the section when
# missing. Idempotent: prints "changed" or "unchanged" on stdout so callers
# know whether an avahi-daemon restart is needed. Does NOT restart avahi.
# Exits nonzero when the conf is missing or an edit fails — callers treat
# that as a warning, not a fatal error.

# Overridable for tests only; on-device callers use the default.
